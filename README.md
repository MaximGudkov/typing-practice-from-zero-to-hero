# TYPING PRACTICE
## I collected almost all the functionality of the typing module and created problems on non-obvious topics (for example Generics, Protocols, Tree Annotation and much more)
## First you can check ./remember directory to remember base types from typing
## Then you can start implementing tasks from ./tasks.txt (they are quite complex and abstract, so if you couldnâ€™t solve it yourself, you can look at the solution to the problem in the ./practice directory without remorse)
### If you decide to play with the code, keep the instructions:
    git clone https://github.com/MaximGudkov/typing-practice-from-zero-to-hero.git
    
    Making virtual environment if needed:
        Windows:
            python -m venv venv
            venv/Scripts/activate
        Linux:
            python3 -m venv venv
            source venv/bin/activate

    pip install mypy
