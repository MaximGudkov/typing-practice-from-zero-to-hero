# TYPING MODULE PRACTICE
#### Remember some unusual features from typing module (for example Generics, Protocols, Tree Annotation and much more)
##### 1. You can start with ./remember directory, just remember some basics
##### 2. Let's implement some tasks from ./tasks.txt. Some tasks are quite abstract (if you're stuck, see the solution)
#
#### If you decide to play with the code, keep the instructions:
    git clone https://github.com/MaximGudkov/typing-practice-from-zero-to-hero.git
    
    Making virtual environment if needed:
        Windows:
            python -m venv venv
            venv/Scripts/activate
        Linux:
            python3 -m venv venv
            source venv/bin/activate

    pip install mypy
